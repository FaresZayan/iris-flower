## 2Ô∏è‚É£ Iris Flower Classification ‚Äì **iris.ipynb**

**Goal:** Classify iris flowers into species (`Setosa`, `Versicolor`, `Virginica`) using their petal and sepal measurements.
**Key Steps:**

* Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) with visualizations
* Data splitting into train/test
* Model Training (Logistic Regression / Decision Tree / KNN)
* Accuracy and classification report evaluation

**Tech Stack:**
`Python`, `Pandas`, `Matplotlib`, `Seaborn`, `Scikit-learn`
